  // Each feature folder's README.md is a ledger. doc-lint fails the build if a
  // shipped screenshot (images/*.png) isn't in the ledger, or a feature gate
  // (a *<feature>*.spec.ts) isn't listed.
  // Armed now that the first real feature (contract-intelligence) ships a ledger +
  // golden screenshots (bootstrap §A Step 5). A feature folder with no captured
  // screenshots yet (still being authored) is not held to the ledger; the moment it
  // ships a screenshot, a ledgered README is required.
  // The shared-engine folder is INFRASTRUCTURE, not a user-facing feature with a
  // capability/screenshot ledger — it is exempt.
  requireFeatureLedger: true,
  featuresDir: "docs/features",
  ledgerExemptFeatures: ["shared-engine"], // infrastructure ref doc, not a capability ledger

  // ── Forbidden source markers (anti debug-stub) ──────────────────────────
  // A removable-handler probe (flipping a gate to "always fail" to prove it bites)
  // is a LOCAL experiment that must be reverted before staging. One got committed +
  // deployed once and forced every answer to "Rejected" in prod
  // (docs/gotchas/committed-debug-stub-broke-prod.md). This scans tracked source for
  // those markers and fails the build, so a debug stub can't be merged.
